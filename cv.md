# About myself

I am 24 years old. My current job is full of ordinary and uninteresting routine. However, among my colleagues, I have established myself as a responsible, reliable and executive person. I have always wanted to try my hand at web development, because I am attracted by the tasks that this activity poses for itself. I know I still have a lot to learn, but I believe that with the right approach, I will eventually achieve my goal. The main thing is to never stop working and always be ready to learn something new !
