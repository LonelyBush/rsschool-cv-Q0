# About myself

I graduated from the university with a degree in Economics and Organization of Production with the assigned profession of engineer-economist. At the moment I work as a manager for foreign economic relations. My responsibilities include the sale of products for export. I work and communicate with European customers. I organize sales logistics, keep records of sales, and also control accounts receivable.
Also, my responsibilities include maintaining and filling the company's website with information.
Why do I want to try my hand at the front-end direction? 
Because I always wanted to create something new not just add content.
